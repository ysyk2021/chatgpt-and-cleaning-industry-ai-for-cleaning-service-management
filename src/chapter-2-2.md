Early History of Cleaning Services

Cleaning services have existed in various forms throughout human history. In ancient civilizations, such as Greece and Rome, public bathhouses were common, and attendants were responsible for keeping them clean.

In the early 20th century, advancements in sanitation led to the development of modern cleaning methods and techniques.

The Rise of Professional Cleaning Services

The industrial revolution in the 19th century brought about significant changes in the way cleaning services were provided. With the rise of factories and large industrial buildings, cleaning became more complex and specialized. Professional cleaning companies began to emerge, offering specialized services and equipment to meet the growing demand.

Technological Advancements in Cleaning Service Management

The 20th century saw significant technological advancements in cleaning service management. The introduction of vacuum cleaners, steam cleaners, and other specialized equipment made cleaning faster and more efficient. Chemicals and detergents were also developed that could remove dirt and stains more effectively than traditional cleaning methods.
